    "Hi, I'm Naya Singhania! I've been passionate about coding since I was 12, and that enthusiasm has driven me to explore various technologies and frameworks since then. I'm currently a Computer Science student at SJSU, where I've honed my skills in Next.js and React. I enjoy creating dynamic web applications that provide seamless user experiences, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.",
    "In addition to my development work, I have a deep interest in AI and using it in development. For instance, I am developing a full-stack application that analyzes user music listening history to create a listener persona. I also developed ChairSense, a project that utilizes various sensors and a microcontroller to implement obstacle detection on wheelchairs, showcasing my commitment to leveraging technology for accessibility. Beyond tech, I am passionate about choir and producing music, where I express my creativity and connect with others through music.",
    "As I continue my journey in tech, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities that will allow me to further develop my skills and gain hands-on experience. If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic developer with a strong foundation in Next.js and a passion for innovation, let's connect! I'm excited to collaborate and explore new possibilities in the tech world."
